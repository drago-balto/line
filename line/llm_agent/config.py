# Default detection pattern for SpeechGuardConfig. Five alternatives, all safe
# to search mid-text (natural TTS speech contains none of them):
#   - ``{\s*"``            — a JSON object opening onto a quoted key
#   - ``ident\s*(\s*[{"]`` — a snake_case identifier called with a JSON/str
#     arg, e.g. ``record_call_summary({``. Requiring ``{`` or ``"`` right after
#     the paren keeps spoken oddities like ``name(at)domain`` from matching.
#   - ``to=\w+\.``          — the harmony tool-call recipient marker
#     (``to=functions.record_call_summary``); pure protocol syntax that
#     survives header corruption and appears well before the JSON payload.
#   - ``functions.<ident>``  — the harmony tool-namespace prefix glued to an
#     identifier (no space after the dot, so prose like "it functions. Also"
#     cannot match).
#   - ``<|``                 — harmony special-token delimiters leaking
#     literally (``<|constrain|>`` etc.); unambiguous non-speech.
# The header-artifact alternatives matter for the observed degraded form
# ``record_call_summary <glitch tokens> json {"summary":...`` where neither a
# paren nor a leading ``{`` exists — they pull detection to (near) offset 0 so
# nothing escapes the holdback window.

@dataclass
class SpeechGuardConfig:
    """Guard spoken text against tool-call payloads leaking into TTS.

    Some reasoning models (observed: ``gpt-5.4-mini``) occasionally write a
    tool call's JSON arguments — or the whole call expression,
    ``record_call_summary({...})`` — into a user-visible ``message`` item
    instead of (or in addition to) the proper ``function_call`` item. Without
    a guard the caller hears raw JSON read out loud.

    When enabled, the ``http_responses`` provider buffers each spoken message
    item with ``lookahead_chars`` of holdback and scans the accumulated text
    for ``detection_pattern`` (``re.search``, so a leak is caught anywhere in
    the item, not just at its head). On a hit the current LLM invocation is
    aborted before any of its tool calls execute or its output is committed
    to history, and the whole invocation is retried up to ``max_retries``
    times with ``retry_note`` injected (via ``retry_note_channel``) and an
    optional ``retry_reasoning_effort`` override to decorrelate the retry
    from the failed attempt. If the caller already heard part of the failed
    attempt, ``bridge_text`` is spoken before the retry; if every attempt
    leaks, ``fallback_text`` is spoken and the turn ends with no tool calls.

    ``bridge_text`` and ``fallback_text`` are caller-audible, so they may be
    given as zero-arg callables instead of strings for agents whose spoken
    language isn't fixed at config time: the callable is invoked at speak
    time (each time it is needed) and returns the line to speak — return
    ``""`` to speak nothing. If the callable raises, the English default is
    spoken and the error logged; leak recovery must not crash. ``retry_note``
    stays a plain string — it is model-facing, and models follow English
    instructions regardless of the conversation language.

    Off by default; enable per agent/model. Only the ``http_responses``
    backend reads it.
